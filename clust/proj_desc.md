# Abriged Project Description

## Main Goals
1.	Provide a segmentation analysis of the reviews of the properties in Boston looking for:

    a.	Renter sentiment towards the property.  
    b.	Location to popular attractions.  
    c.	Average nightly rates per segment (possibly per bed). 

2.	Give a report that describes each segment and possible opportunities that may be available to her. 

## Deliverables

1. Your client knows nothing about statistics or clustering. Your goal is to convey all of the relevant information to her in 6 or fewer pages (12pt).  The first page should be an executive summary with your main conclusions, and the following pages should give segment descriptions as well as useful information that will aid her in her decision making process.
2. I would like an appendix, no more than 4 pages that gives your analysis plan, rationale for making the decisions you made, and a description of the supplied code and cleaned data files that I can run your analysis.

# Full Project Description

You are approached by an investor who wants to invest in properties in the greater Boston area. Her goal is simple: “She wants to find locations that can be rented on Airbnb for top dollar.” To help her in her quest, she wants to look at the differences the reviews for properties that are currently available in Boston.  She wants to find areas that are of interest to visitors and the qualities of a “good review,” and she is interested if there are any areas that seem to have poor reviews in general but are frequently rented due to local tourist attractions.  Her goal is to locate areas/properties that are underserved with quality rental sites. She has selected your team to scour the publically available Airbnb Boston database and investigate the reviews of these properties.

Your Goals are as follows: 
1.	Provide a segmentation analysis of the reviews of the properties in Boston looking for:  

    a.	Renter sentiment towards the property.  
    b.	Location to popular attractions.  
    c.	Average nightly rates per segment (possibly per bed). 
    
2.	Give a report that describes each segment and possible opportunities that may be available to her. 
Deliverable: 
Your client knows nothing about statistics or clustering. Your goal is to convey all of the relevant information to her in 6 or fewer pages (12pt).  The first page should be an executive summary with your main conclusions, and the following pages should give segment descriptions as well as useful information that will aid her in her decision making process.

Appendix:
Given that I do know a little bit about the statistics, I would like an appendix, no more than 4 pages that gives your analysis plan, rationale for making the decisions you made, and a description of the supplied code and cleaned data files that I can run your analysis.
