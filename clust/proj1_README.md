## proj1_start.R

This file contains all the code necessary to begin clustering listings. You can either cluster with just the distance matrix calculated from the document-term matrix, or there is also the option to join on additional listing info with the function `join_list`. If you take the second route, make sure to consider scaling the variables you add on.
