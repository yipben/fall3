## fall3
Code from fall 3 module at the IAA. Classes:

- Clustering (clust) w/ Dr. Matt Wheeler
- Survival Analysis (surv) w/ Matt Austin
- Machine Learning (ml) w/ Dr. Shaina Race
- Simulation (sim) w/ Dr. Aric LaBarr

### Repo overview

This repository has a folder for each of the classes in this module (listed above). All code for each homework should be stored in the corresponding class folder (same location as 'empty.txt' files). Within each class folder there is also a subfolder called 'data' that contains all the datasets for the given class. The text file called 'files.txt' lists the names of the datasets, what homework/project they correspond to, and where they were obtained from; this should be updated every time a new dataset is added to the folder.

### Set-up

See [GitHub directions for cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/). In steps 6 and 7 note that *.../YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY* should be *.../yipben/fall3* instead of your personal user and repository names.

**A note on .gitignore**  
This file includes the names/file types of things that shouldn't be added to the repository. To ignore a file, simply add its filepath relative to the fall3 directory to '.gitignore'. For example, to ignore the file 'imaginary.txt' in the 'surv' folder you would add the line `surv/imaginary.txt` to the gitignore file. If you want to ignore all of a certain file type (e.g. excel files) across ALL subdirectories you would type `**/*.xlsx`.
